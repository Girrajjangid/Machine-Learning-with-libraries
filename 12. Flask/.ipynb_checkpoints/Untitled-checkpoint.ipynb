    "## What Is a REST( Representational state transfer ) API?\n",
    "\n",
    "REST is basically an architectural style of the web services that work as a channel of communication between different computers or systems on the internet. The term REST API is something else.\n",
    "\n",
    "Those application programming interfaces that are backed by the architectural style of REST architectural system are called REST APIs. REST API compliant web services, database systems, and computer systems permit requesting systems to get robust access and redefine representations of web based resources by deploying a predefined set of stateless protocols and standard operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "By these protocols and operations and redeploying the manageable and updatable components without causing the effect on the system, REST API systems deliver fast performance, reliability, and more progression.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What Is a SOAP (Simple Object access protocol) API?\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP is a standard communication protocol system that permits processes using different operating systems like Linux and Windows to communicate via HTTP and its XML. SOAP based APIs are designed to create, recover, update and delete records like accounts, passwords, leads, and custom objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "These offers over twenty different kinds of calls that make it easy for the API developers to maintain their accounts, perform accurate searches and much more. These can then be used with all those languages that support web services.\n",
    "\n",
    "SOAP APIs take the advantages of making web based protocols such as HTTP and its XML that are already operating the all operating systems that are why its developers can easily manipulate web services and get responses without caring about language and platforms at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Differences:\n",
    "1. REST API has no has no official standard at all because it is an architectural style. SOAP API, on the other hand, has an official standard because it is a protocol.\n",
    "2. REST APIs uses multiple standards like HTTP, JSON, URL, and XML while SOAP APIs is largely based on HTTP and XML.\n",
    "3. As REST API deploys multiple standards, so it takes fewer resources and bandwidth as compared to SOAP that uses XML for the creation of Payload and results in the large sized file.\n",
    "4. The ways both APIs exposes the business logics are also different. REST API takes advantage of URL exposure like @path(\"/WeatherService\") while SOAP API use of services interfaces like @WebService.\n",
    "5. SOAP API defines too many standards, and its implementer implements the things in a standard way only. In the case of miscommunication from service, the result will be the error. REST API, on the other hand, don't make emphasis on too many standards and results in corrupt API in the end.\n",
    "6. REST API uses Web Application Description Language, and SOAP API used Web Services Description language for describing the functionalities being offered by web services.\n",
    "7. REST APIs are more convenient with JavaScript and can be implemented easily as well. SOAP APIs are also convenient with JavaScript but don't support for greater implementation."

    "## API Terminology\n",
    "When using or building APIs, you will encounter these terms frequently:\n",
    "\n",
    "**HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)** is the primary means of communicating data on the web. HTTP implements a number of “methods,” which tell which direction data is moving and what should happen to it. The two most common are GET, which pulls data from a server, and POST, which pushes new data to a server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**URL (Uniform Resource Locator)** - An address for a resource on the web, such as `https://programminghistorian.org/about` A URL consists of a **protocol** (`http://`), **domain** (`programminghistorian.org`), and optional **path** (`/about`). A URL describes the location of a specific resource, such as a web page. When reading about APIs, you may see the terms `URL`, `request`, `URI`, or `endpoint` used to describe adjacent ideas. This tutorial will prefer the terms URL and request to avoid complication. You can follow a URL or make a GET request in your browser, so you won’t need any special software to make requests in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)** is a text-based data storage format that is designed to be easy to read for both humans and machines. JSON is generally the most common format for returning data through an API, XML being the second most common.\n",
    "\n",
    "**REST (REpresentational State Transfer)** is a philosophy that describes some best practices for implementing APIs. APIs designed with some or all of these principles in mind are called REST APIs. While the API outlined in this lesson uses some REST principles, there is a great deal of disagreement around this term. For this reason, I do not describe the example APIs here as REST APIs, but instead as web or HTTP APIs."

    "# API Design Principles\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we’ve created a working API with test data that we’ve provided right in our application. Our next version of our API will pull in data from a database before providing it to a user. It will also take additional query parameters, allowing users to filter by fields other than ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before building more functionality into our application, let’s reflect on some of the API design decisions that we’ve made so far. Two aspects of a good API are usability and maintainability, and as we build more functionality into our API, we’ll be keeping many of the following considerations in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing Requests\n",
    "The prevailing design philosophy of modern APIs is called REST. For our purposes, the most important thing about REST is that it’s based on the four methods defined by the HTTP protocol: POST, GET, PUT, and DELETE. These correspond to the four traditional actions performed on data in a database: CREATE, READ, UPDATE, and DELETE. In this tutorial, we’ll only be concerned with GET requests, which correspond to reading from a database."
